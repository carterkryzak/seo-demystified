# Private Blog Networks

Private blog networks \(PBNs\) are essentially smaller websites that you own \(of which you do not publiclly disclose\) which link to your main site to provide link juice to. Their sole purpose is to create an astroturfed perception of success to the search engine.

Usually, PBNs are built on top of expired domains that previously had a high degree of relevance in the niche that you are trying to rank in \(they possessed a lot of backlinks that gave them power in the eye of the search engine\). These domains have expired and gotten deleted for a variety of reasons, but importantly, they still have powerful relevance in the eyes of search engine, which could be directed to your site.
