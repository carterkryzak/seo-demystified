# Grey and Black Hat SEO

Something you have to understand is that Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, etc. all don't want you to rank high organically. They want you to purchase advertising space from them directly, which would increase their own profit margins. Ranking organically would be of marginal use to them, since you as a webmaster need traffic from a search engine more than they need your individual site to get people coming to them in the first place.
