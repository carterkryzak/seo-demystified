# Grey and Black Hat SEO

Simply put, black hat SEO is just any form of search engine optimization that search engines themselves prohibit you from using in their spam policy or terms and conditions.

### Rationale

It may be advantageous for users to think outside the traditional SEO box, which involves trying to improve the popularity of your own brand.

### Not All Black Hat

You may have already heard bad things of black-hat SEO. While it is true that most forms of Black Hat SEO serve against the interest of most on the internet who just want to read high quality informational content.

### Paid vs. Organic Ranking

Something you have to understand is that Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, etc. all don't want you to rank high organically. They want you to purchase advertising space from them directly, which would increase their own profit margins. **Ranking organically would be of marginal use to them**, since you as a webmaster need traffic from a search engine more than they need your individual site to get people coming to them in the first place.

Black Hat gives the average webmaster far more power than is normally delegated to them
