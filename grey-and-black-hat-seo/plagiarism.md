# Plagiarism

It is indeed a very time-consuming effort to create original content for viewers that they would find relevant and important \(like this site\), so many webmasters find it easier to copy and paste content from other websites and rank them on their own site. This is a violation of search engine policy \(duplicate content\), and could result in a deindexing of your website.

Sometimes, these webmasters may use a text spinner to obfuscate the original text content, which would make it harder for search engine bots to detect duplicate content, at the cost of maintaining a readable site.
