# README

Search engine optimization \(commonly referred to as simply SEO\) is the process in which your website becomes closer to the top of search engine results, which comes as a result of you optimizing a variety of factors that search engines take into account when ranking sites.

This topic, although quite simple in abstract terms, can be quite challenging to beginners that don't have experience with either algorithms or marketing.

The goal with this GitBook is to explain to the average person, how SEO works, and how they could apply SEO to their own website to rank it higher.

Links in the navigation to the left are just the primary topics of discussion that are relevant to SEO.
