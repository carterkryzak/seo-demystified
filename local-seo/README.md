# Local SEO

Go search " steakhouse" on Google. You are likely to get tailored results based on your current location, along with a map preview of all the steakhouses in your area. My example for the Dallas area is shown below.

The scope of these search results is only local. People aren't likely to look for a local business that they aren't practically going to go to. It would be damaging to Google's conversion rate if they had given steakhouses in the Bay Area instead of the Dallas area in their search results.
