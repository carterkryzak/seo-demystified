# Why Search?

Internet surfers don't have time to look manually through thousands of pages on the internet in order to find the one that they need. This process of sorting and categorizing the vast swaths of the internet has been made possible through search engines, which crawl pages on the internet continuously, and recommend. People will only need to look for the keyword on a search engine in order to find wha.

### Indexing

Indexing is the process in which a search engine bot \(or program\) downloads webpages to parse and collect data from them \(including keywords, domain names, and links\), and further goes into the outbound links of the webpage, creating a list of relevant webpages and sites to show to users.

### Ordering Results

After a search engine has crawled a large list of websites, and made track of all the statistics and data necessary to rank a site in its search database.
